<p>A program might need to execute different commands depending on the state of variables. To achieve this in Python we use If/Else statements.</p>

<p>below is a simple If/Else statement</p>

<p> You can chain if statements together by using 'Elif', like in the example below: </p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Ensure your code is indented to tell the compiler it's a seperate section.</li>
    <li>Don't forget the colon on the end of the if, elif, and else statements.</li>
    <li>When evalutating 'equals to' statements remember to use a double equals ('==') </li>

</ul>
